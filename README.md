# Lekh
Lekh aims to develop a Machine Learning Program that recognizes hand written text in English language. The project should be able to correctly recognize hand written text just by the the digital image data that it receives. The software aims in the direction of providing a more accurate and more smooth experience of handwriting recognition for use in smart gadgets of the age. So far, we have achieved this using some of the most widely used Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor Classification, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Classifier, whose performances are compared below. Further, we hope to increase our efficiency with Deep Learning algorithm, multilayered Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Theano and Tensorflow.
